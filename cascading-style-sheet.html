        <p>Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, plays a pivotal role in the realm of web development by providing a powerful mechanism for styling and formatting HTML documents. Developed as a separate technology from HTML, CSS enables developers to control the visual presentation of web pages, ensuring consistency and aesthetics across various devices. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to define their appearance, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. The "cascading" nature of CSS allows for a hierarchy of styles, with rules applied from multiple sources like external style sheets, internal styles within HTML documents, and inline styles directly within HTML tags. This separation of content and presentation enhances the maintainability and flexibility of web projects. CSS not only facilitates the creation of visually appealing websites but also contributes to responsive design, allowing web pages to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. With continuous updates and the evolution of CSS3, developers can leverage advanced features like animations, transitions, and flexbox/grid layouts, pushing the boundaries of creative and interactive web design. In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, CSS remains an essential tool, empowering designers and developers to craft engaging and user-friendly digital experiences.</p>
