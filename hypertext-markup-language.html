        <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental building block of the World Wide Web, providing the structural foundation for creating and designing web pages. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s, HTML is a markup language that uses tags to structure content on a webpage, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. HTML documents are composed of a nested structure, with tags indicating the beginning and end of elements, creating a hierarchy that browsers interpret to render the content visually. The versatility of HTML lies in its simplicity and universality, as it serves as the backbone for presenting information across various devices and platforms. Over time, HTML has evolved through different versions, with HTML5 being the latest standard, introducing new features like native support for audio and video, semantic elements for improved document structure, and enhanced form controls. HTML often collaborates with cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web experiences. In the dynamic landscape of web development, HTML remains a cornerstone, constantly adapting to technological advancements and user expectations, shaping the way information is presented and consumed on the Internet.</p>
